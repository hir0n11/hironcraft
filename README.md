# HironCraft

Standalone personal World of Warcraft addon combining the customized chat scanner with the selected ProfitHUB workflow modules.

Included modules:

- Chat scanner and linked-account synchronization
- Buttons
- GoldDeposit
- Orders
- QuestShopping
- Shop
- StackAssist

Personal orders that are missing any customer-provided required reagent are
offered as `Decline` instead of `Claim`. The matching chat row receives a yellow
cross; a later successfully completed order replaces it with the green check.
Completion state is scoped to an individual customer request, so an older job
does not mark a later request from the same customer as complete.

The original CraftScan and ProfitHUB folders are not required after migration and can no longer overwrite this copy when they update.

## Crafting orders interface (0.3.4)

The order list uses the full width of Blizzard's profession window, with the
control panel attached outside its right edge. Native buttons, framed panels
and gold selection highlights keep the classic WoW look. Cyrillic-capable
addon fonts keep Russian labels readable on English clients too. Existing
queue settings and key bindings are kept.

- **Crafting** contains reagent quality, concentration, finishers and tools.
- The **Queue** settings tab contains profit filters and automatic selection settings.
- Queue, knowledge selection, Shopping and Clear are always available beneath
  both settings tabs, alongside the action button, selection count and status.
  Settings scrollbars appear only when their contents do not fit.
- To select profitable orders plus all knowledge rewards, click **Queue**,
  then **Queue: knowledge**. The latter adds to the current selection and
  ignores minimum profit (including missing prices), without changing saved
  filters or previously selected reagents. Unknown recipes and orders requiring
  concentration remain excluded; missing reagents can be added to Shopping.
- Use the list's **+/−** button to switch between compact and detailed rows.
  Detailed rows include the customer. The **Profit** column stays visible in
  both layouts, including narrow windows. Additional icons are available
  through a plain **+N** hover label when their column is full.
- **Refresh** reloads orders when no order action is in progress. Clicking the
  item row still opens the original Blizzard order details.
- Labels are centered within the classic buttons; craft progress inherits
  the action button's scale and stays inside its border. The binding-clear
  control uses WoW's square close button. Empty lists show a single message.
- Choosing Patron, Guild or Public immediately stops the current automatic
  Personal-tab preparation. Auto on open still works on the next opening.
- Reagent icons have reserved spacing for quality badges and quantities.
  Profit has a wider column and remains on one line, using decimal gold or
  compact k/m notation when necessary. Hover for the detailed amount.

This release changes presentation; the reported finisher craft-start issue
is not considered resolved by the interface redesign.

## First start and settings migration

1. Install the `HironCraft` folder on both WoW clients.
2. For the first login, leave the original CraftScan and ProfitHUB addons enabled. HironCraft imports their loaded SavedVariables into its own uniquely named databases.
3. Log in once on every character whose per-character ProfitHUB settings must be copied.
4. Log out or run `/reload`, disable the original CraftScan and all ProfitHUB modules, and keep only HironCraft enabled.
5. Repeat the installation and migration on the second linked account. Both accounts must run HironCraft to use its isolated `HIRONCRAFT_SCAN` communication channel.

If the first login was made with the originals disabled, enable them and run `/hcmigrate force`, then `/reload`.

Commands:

- `/hc` or `/hironcraft` — open HironCraft settings
- `/hcs` or `/hironcraftscan` — open the chat scanner configuration
- `/ph` — open the integrated workflow settings
- `/hcmigrate force` — overwrite HironCraft settings from currently loaded original addons

## Updating

Only update or replace the `HironCraft` folder. Updates to `CraftScan`, `AhUI` or the old ProfitHUB module folders do not change this addon.

Run `scripts/Build.ps1` to create a clean versioned ZIP without repository and development files.

The editable high-resolution icon source is kept in `artwork/`; the game uses the optimized `Media/HironCraftIcon.tga` version. A PNG preview is stored beside it.
