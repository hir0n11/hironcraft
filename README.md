# HironCraft

Standalone personal World of Warcraft addon combining the customized chat scanner with the selected ProfitHUB workflow modules.

Included modules:

- Chat scanner and linked-account synchronization
- Buttons
- GoldDeposit
- Orders
- QuestShopping
- Shop
- StackAssist

The original CraftScan and ProfitHUB folders are not required after migration and can no longer overwrite this copy when they update.

## First start and settings migration

1. Install the `HironCraft` folder on both WoW clients.
2. For the first login, leave the original CraftScan and ProfitHUB addons enabled. HironCraft imports their loaded SavedVariables into its own uniquely named databases.
3. Log in once on every character whose per-character ProfitHUB settings must be copied.
4. Log out or run `/reload`, disable the original CraftScan and all ProfitHUB modules, and keep only HironCraft enabled.
5. Repeat the installation and migration on the second linked account. Both accounts must run HironCraft to use its isolated `HIRONCRAFT_SCAN` communication channel.

If the first login was made with the originals disabled, enable them and run `/hcmigrate force`, then `/reload`.

Commands:

- `/hc` or `/hironcraft` — open HironCraft settings
- `/hcs` or `/hironcraftscan` — open the chat scanner configuration
- `/ph` — open the integrated workflow settings
- `/hcmigrate force` — overwrite HironCraft settings from currently loaded original addons

## Updating

Only update or replace the `HironCraft` folder. Updates to `CraftScan`, `AhUI` or the old ProfitHUB module folders do not change this addon.

Run `scripts/Build.ps1` to create a clean versioned ZIP without repository and development files.

The editable high-resolution icon source is kept in `artwork/`; the game uses the optimized `Media/HironCraftIcon.tga` version. A PNG preview is stored beside it.
